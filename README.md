# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Full Stack Nano - IAM Final Project

Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

You have been called on to demonstrate your newly learned skills to create a full stack drink menu application. The application must:

1) Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2) Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3) Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4) Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

## Tasks

There are `@TODO` comments throughout the project. We recommend tackling the sections in order. Start by reading the READMEs.

## About the Stack

We started the full stack application for you. It is desiged with some key functional areas:

### Backend

The directory contains a partially completed Flask server with a pre-written SQLAlchemy module to simplify your data needs. You will need to complete the required endpoints, configure, and integrate Auth0 for authentication.

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) are libraries to handle the lightweight sqlite database. Since we want you to focus on auth, we handle the heavy lift for you in `./src/database/models.py`. We recommend skimming this code first so you know how to interface with the Drink model.

- [jose](https://python-jose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption for JWTs. Useful for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTS.

## Running the server

From within the `./src` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

Each time you open a new terminal session, run:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=api.py;
```

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

## Tasks

### Setup Auth0

1. Create a new Auth0 Account
2. Select a unique tenant domain
3. Create a new, single page web application
4. Create a new API
    - in API Settings:
        - Enable RBAC
        - Enable Add Permissions in the Access Token
5. Create new API permissions:
    - `get:drinks-detail`
    - `post:drinks`
    - `patch:drinks`
    - `delete:drinks`
6. Create new roles for:
    - Barista
        - can `get:drinks-detail`
    - Manager
        - can perform all actions
7. Test your endpoints with [Postman](https://getpostman.com). 
    - Register 2 users - assign the Barista role to one and Manager role to the other.
    - Sign into each account and make note of the JWT.
    - Import the postman collection `./starter_code/backend/udacity-fsnd-udaspicelatte.postman_collection.json`
    - Right-clicking the collection folder for barista and manager, navigate to the authorization tab, and including the JWT in the token field (you should have noted these JWTs).
    - Run the collection and correct any errors.
    - Export the collection overwriting the one we've included so that we have your proper JWTs during review!

### Implement The Server

There are `@TODO` comments throughout the `./backend/src`. We recommend tackling the files in order and from top to bottom:

1. `./src/auth/auth.py`
2. `./src/api.py`


### Frontend

The `./client` directory contains a complete Ionic frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. You will only need to update the environment variables found within (./client/src/environment/environment.ts) to reflect the Auth0 configuration details set up for the backend app. 

[View the README.md within ./client for more details.](./client/README.md)
